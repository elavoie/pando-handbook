# Sub-directories

The following directories contain data and utilities to facilitate the replication of the middleware19 experiments:

1. ````./analysis````: provides the ````throughput.js```` script to compute the average throughput of devices from the data saved in experiments, as well as the results of runs (````runs/results````);
2. ````./deploy````: provides scripts to help deployments on some volunteer devices. The chrome-tabs enables deploying a large number of tabs from a single node easily.
3. ````./experiments````: provides the logs that were used to construct the paper table. The throughputs are computed from the self-reported measurements from all the devices in the ````devices.txt```` file. The ````output.txt```` is provided for reference to compare with the throughput at the output of Pando.
4. ````./run````: provides scripts to replicate the experiments using the example applications. Those automatically save the performance logs in subdirectories of ````./run/results````.
