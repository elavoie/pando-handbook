# Pando Handbook

Pando is a decentralized computing commandline tool that enables a stream of values to be processed collaboratively by volunteers on the web.

This handbook shows how to install and use pando, as well as how to reproduce experiments performed for submitted and published papers. If you obtained this handbook from a publication archive, it is actually a valid Git repository. It can therefore be updated from the latest version on GitHub (http://github.com/elavoie/pando-handbook).

# Publication-Specific Instructions for Reproducing Experiments

These instructions are aimed at Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) members and other researchers and developers that wish to verify our claims as well as expand upon our work. Each publication is documented in its own directory, with all the data we obtained during our own experiments, the software and hardware configuration that were used, and the helper scripts we used. The specific version of Pando and the version of this handbook used are mentioned for each publication for replicability while allowing non-backward compatible changes to Pando in later versions.
